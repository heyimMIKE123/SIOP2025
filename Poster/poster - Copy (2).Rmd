# Introduction

**Virtual reality (VR)** training programs are increasingly popular in business, with research showing their effectiveness over traditional methods (Howard & Gutworth, 2020; Ren et al., 2015). **Artificial intelligence (AI)** advancements have led to AI-enhanced VR training programs. With rapid technological progress (Kurzweil, 2001) and the buzz around AI and VR (Dutt et al., 2020), quality research is crucial before moving to the next big advancement. This review analyzes best practices and preliminary findings in AI-VR research, revealing gaps and providing guidelines for future studies.

`RQ 1:` Are the current VR and AI training programs utilizing best practices from the science of training?

`RQ 2:` Are current studies on AI-enhanced VR training programs utilizing a proper control group?

`RQ 3:` Do current studies on AI-enhance VR training programs have a sufficient number of people to make inferences about their effectiveness?

`RQ 4:` What are the preliminary findings? Does adding AI to VR training result in a better experience for the trainee, greater learning, or better on-the-job performance than regular VR training?

`RQ 1:` The best practices **most implemented** in AI-VR training studies are features that enable trainees to use the same cognitive processes they would in the transfer environment (1f; `96%`), features that boost psychological fidelity (1j; `96%`), and the use of valid learning/outcome taxonomies (1k; `80%`).

The **least implemented** are learning objectives (1a; `24%`), self-efficacy boosts (1b; `24%`), increases in engagement and interest (1d; `20%`), and progress monitoring (1g; `28%`).

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 3px dotted red; width: 100%; margin: 20px 0;">

`RQ 2:` Most studies did not utilize a proper control group to test the incremental effects that AI brings to VR training technologies (`92%`).

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 3px dotted red; width: 100%; margin: 20px 0;">

`RQ 3:` Most studies did not have adequate sample sizes, and only `2` that did utilized proper control groups

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 3px dotted red; width: 100%; margin: 20px 0;">

`RQ 4:` Of the articles that do compare AI-VR to VR training programs, **AI was found to significantly enhance training outcomes**.

Qi et al. (2021) found that AI had a **moderate effect** on performance. Truong et al. (2022) demonstrated that AI **doubles the log-odds** of passing a trial, indicating improved success rates with AI integration in VR training.
