"","Title","1a. Are learning objectives created and clarified to the reader?","1b. Is the training delivered in a way that builds trainees' belief in their ability to learn and display trained skills (self-efficacy)?","1c. Does the training encourage trainees to participate in training to learn rather than to appear capable (promotes a learning orientation)?","1d. Does the training engage trainees and build their interest?","1e. Does the training utilize a valid training strategy and design? This involves providing information, giving demonstrations of good and bad behaviors, allowing opportunities to practice, and providing meaningful feedback.","1f. Does the training allow trainees to use the same cognitive processes that they will have to in the environment this learning should transfer to?","1g. Does the training keep trainees' attention by allowing trainees to monitor their progress toward goals?","1h. Does the training encourage trainees to make errors?","1i. Does the training provide sufficient structure to trainees when allowing them to make decisions about their learning experience?","1j. Does the training simulation increase psychological fidelity (e.g. job-relevant, technology used fits the task)?","1k. Does the training use established learning / outcome taxonomies (e.g. affective, cognitive, and/or behavioral indicators)?","2. Are current studies on AI-enhanced VR training programs utilizing a proper control group?","3. Do current studies on AI-enhanced VR training programs have a sufficient number of people to make inferences about their effectiveness?","4. What are the preliminary findings: Does adding AI to VR training result in a better experience for the trainee, greater learning, or better on the job performance than regular VR training?"
