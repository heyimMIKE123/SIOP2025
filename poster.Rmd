# Introduction

**Very little research** exists highlighting the presence or absence of training best practices.

`RQ 1:` Are the current VR and AI training programs utilizing best practices from the science of training?

`RQ 2:` Are current studies on AI-enhanced VR training programs utilizing a proper control group?

`RQ 3:` Do current studies on AI-enhance VR training programs have a sufficient number of people to make inferences about their effectiveness?

`RQ 4:` What are the preliminary findings? Does adding AI to VR training result in a better experience for the trainee, greater learning, or better on-the-job performance than regular VR training?
